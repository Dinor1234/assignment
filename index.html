        I joined AltSchool school of Engineering to prove to myself that IT IS POSSIBLE. All my life, I have
        evaded anything that involves calculations or complications. I have told myself I cannot do this because
        I do not have a science background and it is too hard. However, Phillipians 4:13 reminds me that I can
        do all things through Christ who strengthens me and so I joined AltSchool as a personal challenge that I
        CAN!. My goal is to be the most accomplished Cloud Engineer my generation has seen. Although my growth has
        been slow, albeit steady. With God on my side, and my wife constantly backing me, I will achieve this!
